# Using Ember Appkit Rails

Rails is a great platform for hosting an Ember application, but the standard setup
(`ember-rails`) doesn't take advantage of ES6 modules (the next evolution in
Javascript development). This talk will walk you through how to use `ember-appkit-rails`
to author using ES6 today. Along the way we will discuss best practices for project
layout and unit testing.
